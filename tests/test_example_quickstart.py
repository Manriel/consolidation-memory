"""The documented quickstart examples must actually run.

`README.md` and `examples/python-quickstart/quickstart.py` are the first code a
new user executes. Nothing else in CI covers them, so a snippet that reads
`.episodes[0].content` while `RecallResult.episodes` holds plain dicts shipped
green until someone ran it by hand. These tests execute the snippets instead of
restating them, so the shape they teach stays the shape the client returns.
